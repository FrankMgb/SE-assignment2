Issues: 
Trying to clone a repository that was created through the user interface that is featured in a replit Project.

Solution Just don’t clone the repository at all since replit will already have remote access to it.
Also ensure that both the github and replit account are synchronized.
Finally I pushed it  the feature 1 branch to make sure everything is working well and it was. 

Note: by the way Mrs.Kim None of my responding to my messages about being assigned to review my pull request. I guess they though since it’s spring break no college coursework should be done :(
So instead i stuck with being the owner of my request.
